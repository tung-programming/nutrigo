    "answer": "All three (Frooti, Maaza, Slice) are similar - high sugar fruit drinks (around 10-12g per 100ml) with limited real fruit content.

  },
  {
    "question": "Thumbs Up vs Thums Up Zero - which is better?",

  {
    "question": "Which packaged peanut butter is healthiest?",
    "answer": "Healthiest peanut butters have: 100% peanuts (or 95%+ with salt), no added sugar, no hydrogenated oils, and natural separation.

  },
  {

  {
    "question": "Which packaged paneer brand is best?",
    "answer": "Quality paneer brands include Amul, Mother Dairy, Govardhan, and Nandini - all score well (75-85/100) for fresh paneer. Scan with NutriGo! Look for: 100% cow milk, no preservatives, recent manufacturing date, and proper refrigeration. Fresh paneer from local dairy is often better than packaged. Check expiry dates!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Bournvita vs Horlicks - which is healthier?",
    "answer": "Both Bournvita and Horlicks are malted health drinks with high sugar (70-75% of calories from sugar!). Both score low (35-45/100) despite health claims. Scan with NutriGo for truth!

  },
  {
    "question": "Sunfeast vs Britannia biscuits - which brand is better?",
    "answer": "Both Sunfeast and Britannia offer various biscuits with similar quality. Health scores depend on specific products - digestive biscuits (55-65/100) vs cream biscuits (35-45/100).

  },
  {
    "question": "Maggi sauce vs Kissan ketchup - which is better?",
    "answer": "Both are condiments with high sodium and sugar. Maggi sauce has more sodium (score: 30-35/100), Kissan ketchup has more sugar (score: 35-40/100). Scan both with NutriGo!

  },
  {
    "question": "Which instant oats brand is best?",
    "answer": "Best instant oats brands include Saffola, Quaker, Kellogg's, and Bagrry's. Avoid flavored variants with added sugar. Plain instant oats score high (80-90/100). Scan with NutriGo!

  },
  {
    "question": "Nutella vs Hershey's chocolate spread - which is better?",
    "answer": "Both are sugar and palm oil bombs! Nutella (score: 25-30/100) and Hershey's spread (score: 25-30/100) have 55%+ sugar and unhealthy fats. Scan with NutriGo for shocking sugar content! Neither is healthy despite marketing. Better alternatives: Natural peanut butter, almond butter, or homemade date-nut spread!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Which packaged honey brand is pure?",
    "answer": "Pure honey brands include Dabur, Patanjali, Apis Himalaya, and local beekeepers. But adulteration is common! Pure raw honey scores well (75-80/100). Scan with NutriGo!

  },
  {
    "question": "Tropicana juice vs Minute Maid - any difference?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I scan packaged products in regional Indian languages?",
    "answer": "Yes! NutriGo's AI can read nutrition labels in multiple Indian languages including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, and Gujarati.

  },
  {
    "question": "What should I look for on packaged food labels?",
    "answer": "Key things to check on packaged food labels: 1) Ingredient list (shorter is better, recognize items), 2) Nutritional facts (calories, protein, fiber, sugar, sodium), 3) Serving size (often misleadingly small!), 4) Health claims vs actual nutrition, 5) Expiry dates, 6) Allergen warnings. NutriGo does all this analysis for you instantly - just scan!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Are 'sugar-free' packaged products actually healthy?",
    "answer": "Not always! 'Sugar-free' often means artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose, saccharin) which have their own concerns. These products may still be processed and lack nutrients. Scan sugar-free products with NutriGo to check ingredients! Some score better than sugary versions, but natural low-sugar whole foods are always best. Check what replaces the sugar!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'natural flavors' mean on packaged food?",
    "answer": "'Natural flavors' is a vague term that can include 100+ FDA-approved ingredients derived from plant or animal sources but heavily processed. They're not always healthier than artificial flavors! NutriGo flags products with excessive flavorings. Look for foods where real ingredients provide flavor - like 'real strawberries' instead of 'natural strawberry flavor.'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I worry about E-numbers in packaged foods?",
    "answer": "E-numbers are food additives (preservatives, colors, stabilizers) coded in Europe but found globally. Some are harmless (E300 is vitamin C!), others concerning (E102 artificial color). NutriGo identifies and warns about harmful additives! Scan products to check. Generally avoid: E102, E110, E129 (colors), E250 (nitrites), E320 (BHA). Fewer E-numbers = better!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What's the difference between 'best before' and 'expiry date'?",
    "answer": "'Best before' means quality/taste may decline after this date but product is still safe (for dry goods). 'Expiry date' or 'use by' means don't consume after this for safety (for perishables like dairy, meat). NutriGo can't scan dates, but always check labels! When in doubt, use your senses - smell, look, taste a tiny bit!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Are packaged foods with longer shelf life more unhealthy?",
    "answer": "Not automatically, but often yes! Long shelf life usually means: more preservatives, more processing, less moisture (nutrients concentrate in water), and fewer fresh ingredients. However, frozen vegetables and properly canned goods can be nutritious. Scan long shelf-life products with NutriGo to check preservatives and health scores! Fresh is usually better."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'fortified' mean on packaged foods?",
    "answer": "Fortified means vitamins/minerals were added during processing that weren't naturally present. Common in cereals, flour, milk, and salt (iodine). Can be beneficial (preventing deficiencies) or marketing gimmick (fortifying junk food). Scan fortified products with NutriGo! While added nutrients help, getting vitamins from whole foods is always preferable. Don't choose junk food just because it's fortified!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is 'multigrain' better than 'whole grain' on packaged foods?",
    "answer": "NO! 'Multigrain' just means multiple grains, which could be refined. 'Whole grain' means the entire grain kernel (bran, germ, endosperm) is intact - much more nutritious with fiber. Scan both with NutriGo! Look for '100% whole grain' or 'whole wheat' as first ingredient. Multigrain refined flour is still refined! Choose whole grain for maximum nutrition."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does 'made with real fruit' mean?",
    "answer": "'Made with real fruit' often means minimal fruit content - could be 2-5%! Companies use this for marketing. Check ingredients list - fruit should be near the top. Many products use 'fruit juice concentrate' which is basically sugar. Scan with NutriGo to check actual fruit content and sugar levels! Real fruit = whole fruit pieces, not concentrate."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are packaged 'organic' foods always healthier?",
    "answer": "Organic means grown without synthetic pesticides/fertilizers but doesn't automatically mean healthier nutrition. Organic cookies are still cookies! Organic reduces chemical exposure but check overall nutrition. Scan organic products with NutriGo - some score high (organic dal: 90+), others low (organic candy: 30). Focus on whole foods first, organic second."
  },
  {
    "question": "What's 'high fructose corn syrup' and why avoid it?",
    "answer": "High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a cheap sweetener made from corn, sweeter than regular sugar, and linked to obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease when consumed in excess. Found in sodas, packaged sweets, and processed foods. NutriGo warns about HFCS! Avoid products listing it in first 5 ingredients. Regular sugar isn't great either, but HFCS is worse!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need to scan every packaged product I buy?",
    "answer": "Ideally scan new products or regular purchases to understand what you're eating! Once you've scanned a product, NutriGo saves it to history. You don't need to rescan the same item unless checking for reformulation. Scan when: trying new brands, comparing similar products, unsure about health claims, or shopping for family members with dietary restrictions. Knowledge is power!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can NutriGo help me if I'm allergic to something?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! NutriGo's allergen detection specifically identifies common allergens (gluten, dairy, nuts, soy, eggs, fish, shellfish) in packaged products. Scan before buying to avoid triggers! While we're very accurate, always double-check labels yourself for severe allergies. Use NutriGo as a helpful tool, not replacement for careful reading when health is at stake."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do some healthy-looking products score low?",
    "answer": "Marketing tricks! Products labeled 'natural,' 'healthy,' or 'wholesome' may still have high sugar, sodium, unhealthy fats, or excessive processing. NutriGo looks beyond marketing at actual nutrition and ingredients. We've seen 'healthy' granola bars score 35/100 due to sugar! Always scan to get truth behind claims. Don't trust front-of-package marketing!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can I suggest products to add to NutriGo's database?",
    "answer": "Yes! If a product isn't in our database, you can still scan it by taking a photo of the label - our AI will analyze it! We continuously expand our database based on user scans. The more people scan, the smarter NutriGo becomes. You're helping build a comprehensive Indian packaged food database. Thank you for contributing!"
  },
  {
    "question": "How often does NutriGo update product information?",
    "answer": "We regularly update our packaged food database with: new products, reformulated items, corrected nutritional info, and manufacturer updates. When companies reformulate, it takes time to update databases. If you notice outdated info, the photo scan feature will analyze current labels. Always check manufacturing dates - recent products have latest formulations!"
  },
  {
    "question": "Can schools use NutriGo for nutrition education?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! NutriGo is perfect for teaching kids about nutrition. Schools can use it to: educate about reading labels, compare snack options for canteens, teach healthy food choices, make nutrition interactive and fun, and help kids develop lifelong healthy habits. We'd love to support nutrition education programs! Contact us for school partnerships."
  },
  {
    "question": "Does NutriGo work for international packaged products?",
    "answer": "Yes! While we focus on Indian brands, NutriGo can scan international packaged products too. The barcode scanner works globally, and photo analysis reads any language label. Health scores use universal nutritional principles. International products in Indian stores are included in our database. Wherever you shop for packaged foods, NutriGo helps you choose wisely!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What's your favorite feature of NutriGo?",
    "answer": "I love the instant health scoring! It takes complex nutrition and makes it simple - just scan and see 70+ means good, below 50 means reconsider. The brand comparison feature is awesome too - finally answer 'Coke or Pepsi?' with data! And warnings about hidden nasties save people from unhealthy choices. NutriGo makes nutrition accessible to everyone!"
