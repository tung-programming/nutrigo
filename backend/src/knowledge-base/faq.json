Combine with strength training and consult a healthcare professional for guidance."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do I build muscle?",

Use NutriGo to scan protein products and choose ones with high protein content, minimal additives, and good health scores. Don't forget carbs for energy and recovery!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What is sugar content?",
    "answer": "Sugar content refers to the amount of sugar in a food product, including both natural and added sugars. NutriGo displays this information clearly and warns you when products have high sugar levels. The WHO recommends limiting added sugars to less than 10% of your daily calorie intake. High sugar consumption is linked to weight gain, diabetes, and heart disease."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much sugar is too much?",
    "answer": "The WHO recommends limiting added sugars to less than 10% of your daily calorie intake - that's about 50 grams (12 teaspoons) for a 2,000-calorie diet. Ideally, aim for less than 25 grams (6 teaspoons) daily. NutriGo warns you when products have high sugar content, helping you stay within healthy limits!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are preservatives?",
    "answer": "Preservatives are substances added to food to prevent spoilage and extend shelf life. While some are natural (like salt and vinegar), many are synthetic chemicals. NutriGo identifies preservatives in products and warns you about potentially harmful ones like nitrates, BHA, BHT, and sulfites, which may cause health concerns for some individuals."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are preservatives bad?",
    "answer": "Not all preservatives are bad! Natural preservatives like salt, sugar, and vinegar are generally safe. However, some synthetic preservatives like BHA, BHT, nitrites, and sulfites may cause health concerns including allergic reactions, digestive issues, or potential carcinogenic effects. NutriGo identifies these preservatives and includes them in the health score calculation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are artificial sweeteners bad?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are additives?",
    "answer": "Food additives are substances added to food for preservation, color, flavor, or texture. They include preservatives, colorings, flavorings, emulsifiers, and sweeteners.

  },
  {
    "question": "What is gluten?",
    "answer": "Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and related grains.

  },
  {
    "question": "Am I allergic to something?",

Always consult your healthcare provider for personalized dietary advice."
  },
  {
    "question": "I have high blood pressure, what should I eat?",
    "answer": "For high blood pressure, focus on low-sodium foods, plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (the DASH diet). Use NutriGo to scan products and check sodium content - aim for less than 2,300mg daily, ideally 1,500mg. Avoid processed foods, which are typically high in sodium. Always follow your doctor's dietary recommendations."
  },
  {
    "question": "I have celiac disease, is NutriGo useful?",

This helps you safely navigate grocery shopping and avoid accidental gluten exposure."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are macros?",
    "answer": "Macros (macronutrients) are the three main nutrients your body needs in large amounts: proteins for muscle building and repair, carbohydrates for energy, and fats for hormone production and nutrient absorption. NutriGo displays the macro breakdown for every scanned product, helping you understand and balance your nutritional intake."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is protein?",
    "answer": "Protein is an essential macronutrient made of amino acids, crucial for building and repairing tissues, muscles, hormones, and enzymes. Adults need about 0.8-1g of protein per kg of body weight daily (more if active). Good sources include meat, fish, eggs, dairy, legumes, nuts, and tofu. NutriGo shows protein content in all scanned products."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much protein do I need?",
    "answer": "Protein needs vary: sedentary adults need 0.8g per kg of body weight daily; active individuals need 1.2-1.6g per kg; athletes and bodybuilders need 1.6-2.2g per kg. For a 70kg person, that's 56-154g daily depending on activity level. Use NutriGo to scan protein-rich products and track your intake through your scan history!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are carbs?",
    "answer": "Carbohydrates are your body's main energy source, broken down into glucose for fuel. They include sugars, starches, and fiber. Complex carbs (whole grains, vegetables, legumes) are healthier than simple carbs (white bread, candy). NutriGo shows total carbs, sugar, and fiber content, helping you choose better carb sources."
  },
  {
    "question": "Should I avoid carbs?",
    "answer": "Not all carbs are bad! Complex carbohydrates from whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and legumes provide essential energy, fiber, and nutrients. It's refined and processed carbs (white bread, sugary snacks) you should limit. NutriGo helps you distinguish between healthy and unhealthy carb sources by analyzing ingredients and providing health scores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are good fats?",
    "answer": "Good fats are unsaturated fats found in avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish, and nut butters. They support heart health, brain function, and hormone production. Limit saturated fats (red meat, butter) and avoid trans fats completely. NutriGo shows fat breakdown and warns about unhealthy fats in products."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is fiber?",
    "answer": "Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that your body can't digest. It's essential for digestive health, helps control blood sugar, lowers cholesterol, and promotes feelings of fullness. NutriGo shows fiber content in products. Look for high-fiber foods like whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts. Adults should aim for 25-30 grams of fiber daily."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are trans fats?",
    "answer": "Trans fats are unhealthy fats created through hydrogenation of oils. They increase bad cholesterol (LDL), decrease good cholesterol (HDL), and significantly raise heart disease risk. NutriGo warns you when products contain trans fats or partially hydrogenated oils. Avoid these completely - look for products with 0g trans fats and no partially hydrogenated oils in ingredients."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is cholesterol?",
    "answer": "Cholesterol is a waxy substance your body needs for cell membranes and hormones. LDL (bad) cholesterol can build up in arteries causing heart disease, while HDL (good) cholesterol removes excess cholesterol. Limit dietary cholesterol from animal products and focus on fiber-rich foods to manage cholesterol levels. NutriGo shows nutritional content to help you make heart-healthy choices."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is sodium?",
    "answer": "Sodium is a mineral essential for fluid balance and nerve function, but most people consume too much through salt in processed foods. High sodium intake is linked to high blood pressure and heart disease. NutriGo displays sodium content and warns when levels are high. Limit sodium to less than 2,300mg daily (about 1 teaspoon of salt)."
  },
  {
    "question": "How much water should I drink?",
    "answer": "General recommendations suggest 8-10 cups (2-2.5 liters) of water daily, but needs vary based on activity level, climate, and body size. A good rule: drink when thirsty and check that your urine is light yellow. While I focus on food nutrition, staying hydrated is crucial for overall health!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are vitamins?",
    "answer": "Vitamins are essential micronutrients your body needs in small amounts for various functions like immunity, bone health, and energy production.

  },
  {
    "question": "What are minerals?",

  },
  {
    "question": "What are calories?",
    "answer": "Calories measure the energy your body gets from food. You need calories for basic functions, physical activity, and digestion.

NutriGo shows calorie content per serving, helping you track energy intake and make informed choices."
  },
  {
    "question": "How many calories should I eat?",
    "answer": "Calorie needs vary: sedentary women need about 1,800-2,000 calories daily; sedentary men need 2,200-2,400; active individuals need 2,000-2,800+.

  },
  {
    "question": "Can I eat on a budget and still be healthy?",
    "answer": "Absolutely! Healthy eating on a budget is possible.

Use NutriGo to scan budget-friendly packaged items and compare prices versus health scores to find the best value for nutritious options. Cooking at home and meal planning also help save money while eating healthy."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is organic food?",
    "answer": "Organic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, GMOs, antibiotics, or growth hormones. While organic doesn't automatically mean healthier or more nutritious, it reduces chemical exposure and supports sustainable farming. NutriGo focuses on nutritional content and ingredient quality rather than organic certification, helping you evaluate any product's health value."
  },
  {
    "question": "Is organic better?",
    "answer": "Organic can be better for reducing pesticide exposure and supporting sustainable farming, but it's not always more nutritious. What matters most is eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whether organic or conventional. Use NutriGo to evaluate nutritional quality regardless of organic status - a conventional apple is healthier than organic cookies!"
  },
  {
    "question": "What are empty calories?",
    "answer": "Empty calories come from foods high in calories but low in nutrients - typically foods with added sugars, unhealthy fats, and minimal vitamins, minerals, or fiber. Examples include soda, candy, chips, pastries, and alcohol. NutriGo's health scores identify these foods with low ratings and warnings, helping you avoid empty-calorie products."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is processed food?",
    "answer": "Processed foods are altered from their natural state through canning, freezing, drying, or adding ingredients. Not all processing is bad - frozen vegetables are healthy! Ultra-processed foods with many additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients are concerning. NutriGo identifies ultra-processed products through ingredient analysis and gives them lower health scores."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is ultra-processed food?",
    "answer": "Ultra-processed foods contain multiple artificial ingredients, preservatives, additives, high levels of sugar, salt, unhealthy fats, and little nutritional value. Examples include soda, chips, instant noodles, packaged snacks, and sugary cereals. NutriGo identifies these characteristics through ingredient analysis and warns you about ultra-processed products with low health scores."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are protein bars healthy?",
    "answer": "It depends! Some protein bars are nutritious with quality ingredients, while others are glorified candy bars with excessive sugar and additives.

Look for bars with 10+ grams of protein, less than 10g sugar, minimal additives, and recognizable ingredients."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is clean eating?",
    "answer": "Clean eating means choosing whole, minimally processed foods and avoiding artificial ingredients, excessive additives, and ultra-processed products.

NutriGo supports clean eating by identifying processed ingredients, additives, preservatives, and giving higher health scores to minimally processed foods with simple, recognizable ingredients."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is meal prep?",
    "answer": "Meal prep involves planning and preparing meals in advance, typically for the week. It saves time, money, and helps maintain healthy eating habits.

    "question": "How do I read nutrition labels?",
    "answer": "Nutrition labels show serving size, calories, macros (protein, carbs, fats), and key nutrients. Start with serving size - all other numbers are based on this. Check calories, then %Daily Values for nutrients (5% or less is low, 20% or more is high). NutriGo simplifies this by scanning labels for you and presenting the information with health scores and warnings."
  },
  {
    "question": "What does serving size mean?",
    "answer": "Serving size is the standardized amount used for nutritional information on labels. It's not necessarily the amount you should eat - it's for comparison purposes. Always check serving size first, as packages may contain multiple servings. NutriGo displays nutrition per serving and helps you understand if you're consuming more than one serving."

  {
    "question": "What are probiotics?",
    "answer": "Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that support digestive health, boost immunity, and improve gut microbiome balance. They're found in fermented foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, kombucha, and miso. When scanning dairy products and fermented foods with NutriGo, look for 'live active cultures' or specific probiotic strains in the ingredients for health benefits."

  {
    "question": "What is keto diet?",
    "answer": "The keto (ketogenic) diet is very low-carb (20-50g daily), moderate protein, and high fat. It puts your body in ketosis, burning fat for energy instead of carbs. Use NutriGo to scan products and choose those very low in carbs and sugar. Check total carbs and subtract fiber to get net carbs. Always consult a healthcare provider before starting keto."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is vegan diet?",

Use NutriGo to scan products for hidden animal ingredients like whey, casein, gelatin, or animal-derived additives. Check the allergen section for dairy and egg alerts."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is vegetarian diet?",
    "answer": "Vegetarians don't eat meat or fish but may consume dairy and eggs (lacto-ovo vegetarian). Some are lacto-vegetarian (dairy, no eggs) or ovo-vegetarian (eggs, no dairy). Use NutriGo to scan products and check ingredients for hidden meat products like gelatin, animal-based broths, or meat-derived additives."

Just scan products and focus on three things: 1) Health score (aim for 70+), 2) Warnings (avoid products with multiple red flags), and 3) Key nutrients (protein, fiber, sugar, sodium). Start with these basics and you'll naturally learn more over time!"
  },

  },
  {
    "question": "How do I start eating healthy?",
    "answer": "Start small! Begin by scanning your current groceries with NutriGo to understand what you're eating.

Use NutriGo to guide better choices when shopping. Progress, not perfection!"
  },
  {
    "question": "I want to be healthier",

  {
    "question": "What's wrong with my diet?",
    "answer": "I can't assess your specific diet, but NutriGo can help you identify issues! Scan your typical foods and look for patterns: Are most products scoring below 50?

  },
  {
    "question": "Can you create a meal plan?",

  },
  {
    "question": "Do I need supplements?",
    "answer": "Most people can get necessary nutrients from a balanced diet, but some may need supplements (vitamin D, B12 for vegans, iron for some women, calcium for those avoiding dairy). Use NutriGo to ensure you're eating nutrient-rich foods. If you're considering supplements, consult a healthcare provider or dietitian for personalized recommendations based on your specific needs and deficiencies."

    "answer": "BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It's calculated as weight(kg) ÷ height(m)². Categories: underweight (<18.5), normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), obese (30+). While useful for populations, BMI doesn't account for muscle mass or body composition.
